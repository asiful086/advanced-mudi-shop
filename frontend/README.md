# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

ABOUT ME:

    I am Asiful Haque Mridul. I am related to this field for  almost 1 year. I have been working on react and node for 7/8 month. When i get free time i like to solve problem in "codewar.com". And i am 5 ranked warior in "codewar.com". I noticed a post from your fb account that, you are providing a new job related react and node. I think i deserve that job according to your requirement. And if you also consider me as perfect,  then you can put me at the first place.

NOTICE:

    1. I am working on this project (https://advanced-mudi-shop.herokuapp.com/). This project is not completed yet. So far, I worked maximum in admin area. So plz emphasize on admin panel first.

    2. Credientials : admin panel -> email: admin@gmail.com , pass: password
                            user  -> email: oopsjonkar@gmail.com, pass: password

    2. File upload in graphql is not working in node js 14. But working in 12 . So its not issue with my project.

    And below i have listed down what i have done so far ->

THE TECH I HAVE USED:

    i. backend ->

        1. node js
        2. express js
        3. apollo graphql for api management
        4. mongodb (mongodb altas cloud) for database


    ii. frontend ->

        1. react js
        2. tailwind css for designing
        3. apollo client for state management
        4. reactive variable (come with apollo client)

THE FEATURES IT PROVIDES:

    i. backend ->

        1. role based authectication using jwt token with graphql (reset password by sending 'reset password link' through  email, which will expire after 10 minutes);
        2. data can be fetched through graphql whataver structure you want
        3. sending mail
        4. stripe for payment


    ii. frontend ->

        1. multiple layouts(backend , frontend)
        2. role based  protected route
        3. jwt refresh token
        4. store user's data ( jwt token ) with reactive variable
        5. shopping cart using reactive variable
        6. if data exists, do not request again to server using "apollo cache"  (its a big feature of apollo client )
